This repository includes the python script `bacnet_get_objects_props.py` (and the wrapper bash script `bacnet_get_objects_props.sh`) to obtain some of the properties of the BACnet objects of a BACnet device and save them into a CSV or a spreadsheet (.ods or .xlsx) file. The BAC0 library is used to obtain the BACnet data, and the Pandas library is used to save the data.
